dokpanel is a free, self-hostable deployment platform that simplifies application and database management with blazing-fast performance powered by Go.

## ✨ Features

- **Lightning Fast**: Built with Go and Fiber v3 for maximum performance
- **Docker Native**: Deploy and manage Docker containers with ease
- **Database Support**: Built-in support for PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, and SQLite
- **RESTful API**: Complete API for automation and integrations
- **Structured Logging**: Production-ready logging with Zerolog
- **Security First**: Helmet middleware, CORS, rate limiting, and secure defaults
- **Environment Management**: Validated config with go-playground/validator
- **Built-in Dashboard**: React (TanStack Router) frontend embedded in Go binary — single binary deploy
- **Minimal Footprint**: ~13MB binary, <50MB idle memory
- **Auto Recovery**: Built-in panic recovery for production stability
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time health checks with memory stats
- goqite->(JobQueue), gopsutil->(Monitoring), and robfig/cron->(Backups/Cleanup)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.26+
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Bun](https://bun.com/) (for building the frontend)
- [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/docs/installation) (cross-platform build tool)
- [Atlas](https://atlasgo.io/getting-started#step-1-install-atlas) (optional, for schema diffing)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vajra-labs/dokpanel.git
cd dokpanel
task web:deps
```

### Development

1. **One-time Setup**: Run the setup command to initialize the development environment (Docker Swarm, Traefik, etc.):

   ```bash
   task setup
   ```

2. **Start Dev Server**: Start the development server with live reload (Air):

   ```bash
   task dev
   ```

   Server starts at `http://localhost:8000`.

3. **Teardown**: Revert the dev setup (remove Traefik, Swarm, etc.):
   ```bash
   task teardown
   ```

### Production Build

```bash
task build   # builds React SPA + embeds into Go binary
task start   # runs the binary
```

### `web/` — Frontend Dashboard

- **TanStack Router** — file-based routing, SPA mode
- **React Compiler** — automatic memoization
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — utility-first styling
- **Embedded in Go binary** via `//go:embed` — single binary deploy
- **Routing**: `/api/*` handled by Go, everything else served by React SPA

## 🔐 Security

- Helmet middleware for security headers
- CORS with credential support
- Request body size limits
- Rate limiting per IP
- Panic recovery middleware
- Config validation on startup

## 📝 API

```bash
GET /api/ping    → "Pong!"
GET /api/pong    → "Ping!"
GET /api/health  → { uptime, version, environment, timestamp, memory }
```
